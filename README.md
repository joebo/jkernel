# Jupyter Notebook/Lab jkernel

The jkernel is a J programming language integration for the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)

## What's new (December 2021)

* Updated for J903
* Improved code robustness

## Prerequisites

* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) Version 4.x (or greater)

* Recommended: [Anaconda from Anaconda Inc.](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution)

* Or: [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (Jupyter must be installed manually)

* A working [J 901](http://www.jsoftware.com) (or greater)

## Installation / Uninstallation / Installation Check

**Please Note:**
It is mandatory to use the **python** command from Anaconda or Miniconda!

NOT the python command that probably comes pre-installed on your operating system.

On *nix OS, the command **which python** shows you the path of the python interpreter.

* python setup<span></span>.py **install**

* python setup<span></span>.py **uninstall**

* python setup<span></span>.py **check**

## Examples

The sub-directories **Jupyter_Notebook_J_Labs** and **Jupyter_Notebook_J_Examples** contain some example notebooks

The sub-directory **Jupyter_Notebook_J_Example_Data** should be copied to the **J user** (jpath '~user') directory to run the example notebooks in **Jupyter_Notebook_J_Examples**

## Run

Run: **jupyter notebook** (from the command line)

Run: **jupyter lab** (from the command line)
